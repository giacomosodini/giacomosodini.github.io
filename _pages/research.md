My main research interests lie at the intersection of Optimal Transport, Non-Smooth analysis, and Calculus of Variations.

**Unbalanced Optimal Transport**

I am interested in the generalization of the classical (i.e. balanced) Optimal Transport problem to the broader setting of pairs of measure which may have different total non-negative masses.


**Non-Smooth Analysis**

Part of my research deals with the study of Sobolev and BV spaces on metric-measure spaces. 


**Evolutions in spaces of measures**

Together with [Giulia Cavagnari](https://sites.google.com/view/giulia-cavagnari) and [Giuseppe Savar√©](https://faculty.unibocconi.eu/giuseppesavare/) we have studied the generalization of maximal monotone evolutions to the Wasserstein space of probability measures.
