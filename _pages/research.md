My main research interests lie at the intersection of Optimal Transport, Non-Smooth analysis, and Calculus of Variations.

**Unbalanced Optimal Transport**

I am interested in the generalization of the classical (i.e. balanced) Optimal Transport problem to the broader setting of pairs of measure which may have different total non-negative masses. Together with [Giuseppe Savaré](https://faculty.unibocconi.eu/giuseppesavare/) we have [studied](/publications#MR4403781) a very general approach to the class of Unbalanced Optimal transport problems, providing a very natural framework where the familiar primal-dual formulation of the classical case are available in suitably generalized forms, among many other relevant properties. The approach we have used is novel also in the classical setting, and has revealed to be fruitful also in the classical balanced setting.

 The most relevant cost in this framework is the celebrated Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) distance. Currently I am working, in collaboration with [Nicolò De Ponti](https://sites.google.com/view/nicolodeponti) and [Luca Tamanini](https://sites.google.com/view/lucatamanini), to better understand the interplay between the HK distance and the classical Wasserstein and Hellinger distances.





**Calculus on metric spaces and spaces of measures**

Part of my research deals with the study of Sobolev and BV spaces on metric-measure spaces. I have worked with [Massimo Fornasier](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/fornasier-massimo) and [Giuseppe Savaré](https://faculty.unibocconi.eu/giuseppesavare/) (and I am currently working with [Enrico Pasqualetto](https://sites.google.com/view/enricopasqualetto/curriculum)) to provide general criteria for the density of smooth subalgebras of continuous functions in these spaces, both in general and when the base space is the Wasserstein space of probability measures or the Hellinger-Kantorovich space of non-negative measures. In these latter cases, the algebra of smooth cylinder functions plays a key role and turns out to be strongly dense in the metric Sobolev space. 

This, besides being interesting from the theoretical point of view, has also natural applied consequences: since cylinder functions are easily computable, one can use them to approximate numerically functions defined on measures, as we have shwon with [Massimo Fornasier](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/fornasier-massimo) and [Pascal Heid](https://sites.google.com/view/pascalheid).





**Geometry and evolutions in spaces of measures**

The metric-Sobolev approach to the differentiability of functions defined on measures is not the only way to define notions of Dirichlet energy and gradients for functions on (probability) measures: there is a (a priori completely unrelated) approach based on Dirichlet forms and more geometric-related notions of gradients for smooth functions. In collaboration with [Lorenzo Dello Schiavo](https://lzdsmath.github.io) we have proved that, for suitable choiches of the reference measures, these approaches are the same, providing a unified approach to the study of the geometric/differential structure of spaces of measures. Currently we are working to better understand the related diffusion process that could rightfully be considered the Brownian motion on the space of measures.

I am also collaborating with [François Delarue](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~delarue/) and [Mattia Martini](https://mattiamartini.github.io/index.html) in the study of PDEs on the space of probability measures, and to the generalization of Feynman–Kac formulas therein.

Together with [Giulia Cavagnari](https://sites.google.com/view/giulia-cavagnari) and [Giuseppe Savaré](https://faculty.unibocconi.eu/giuseppesavare/) we have studied the generalization of maximal monotone evolutions to the Wasserstein space of probability measures. We have studied a large class of operators acting on probability measures, far beyond the well known framework of Wasserstein gradient flows, providing a robust theory which includes the latter as a particular case. This has led also to discover intersesting properties of geodesically convex functionals which are approximable by discrete measures, and also to the study of monotone operators in Hilbert and Banach spaces which are invariant by groups of isometries.
