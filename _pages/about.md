Welcome! I am a mathematician working on Optimal Transport, Non-Smooth Analysis, and Calculus of Variations. Currently I am a PostDoc in the research group of [Ulisse Stefanelli](https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~stefanelli/) at the [Faculty of Mathematics](https://mathematik.univie.ac.at/en/) of the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/).

Until September 20222, I was a PhD student under the supervision of [Giuseppe Savaré](https://faculty.unibocconi.eu/giuseppesavare/) at [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) in the group of [Massimo Fornasier](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/fornasier-massimo). Previously, I completed my bachelor and master studies at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/), advised by [Sandro Salsa](https://www.polimi.it/en/il-politecnico/storia-dellateneo/professors-emeriti-and-honorary/sandro-salsa) and [Luigi Ambrosio](https://www.sns.it/en/persona/luigi-ambrosio).
