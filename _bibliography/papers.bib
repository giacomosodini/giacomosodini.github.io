The main nonlinearities are maximal monotone graphs, without restrictions on the growth. In addition, a Lipschitz continuous perturbation is considered. The existence of global weak solutions is obtained via a regularization and Galerkin approximation method. Uniqueness is also discussed under some additional assumptions.}

This allows us to import in the Wasserstein framework many of the powerful tools from the theory of maximal dissipative operators in Hilbert spaces, deriving existence, uniqueness, stability, and approximation results for the flow generated by a maximal totally dissipative MPVF and the equivalence of its Eulerian and Lagrangian characterizations. We will show that demicontinuous single-valued probability vector fields satisfying a metric dissipativity condition as in our previous work are in fact totally dissipative. Starting from a sufficiently rich set of discrete measures, we will also show how to recover a unique maximal totally dissipative version of a MPVF, proving that its flow provides a general mean field characterization of the asymptotic limits of the corresponding family of discrete particle systems. Such an approach also reveals new interesting structural properties for gradient flows of displacement convex functionals with a core of discrete measures dense in energy.}

abstract = {The challenge of approximating functions in infinite-dimensional spaces from finite samples is widely regarded as formidable. In this study, we delve into the challenging problem of the numerical approximation of Sobolev-smooth functions defined on probability spaces. Our particular focus centers on the Wasserstein distance function, which serves as a relevant example. In contrast to the existing body of literature focused on approximating efficiently pointwise evaluations, we chart a new course to define functional approximants by adopting three machine learning-based approaches: 1. Solving a finite number of optimal transport problems and computing the corresponding Wasserstein potentials. 2. Employing empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization in Wasserstein Sobolev spaces. 3. Addressing the problem through the saddle point formulation that characterizes the weak form of the Tikhonov functional's Euler-Lagrange equation. As a theoretical contribution, we furnish explicit and quantitative bounds on generalization errors for each of these solutions. In the proofs, we leverage the theory of metric Sobolev spaces and we combine it with techniques of optimal transport, variational calculus, and large deviation bounds. In our numerical implementation, we harness appropriately designed neural networks to serve as basis functions. These networks undergo training using diverse methodologies. This approach allows us to obtain approximating functions that can be rapidly evaluated after training. Consequently, our constructive solutions significantly enhance at equal accuracy the evaluation speed, surpassing that of state-of-the-art methods by several orders of magnitude.}

We then provide a relevant application to the case of monotone operators in \(L^p\)-spaces of random variables which are invariant with respect to measure-preserving isomorphisms, proving that they always admit maximal dissipative extensions which are still invariant by measure-preserving isomorphisms. We also show that such operators are law invariant, a much stronger property which is also inherited by their resolvents, the Moreau-Yosida approximations, and the associated semigroup of contractions. These results combine explicit representation formulae for the maximal extension of a monotone operator based on selfdual lagrangians and a refined study of measure-preserving maps in standard Borel spaces endowed with a nonatomic measure, with applications to the approximation of arbitrary couplings between measures by sequences of maps.}
