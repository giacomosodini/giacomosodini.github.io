Taking inspiration from the theories of dissipative operators in Hilbert spaces and of Wasserstein gradient flows for geodesically convex functionals, we study local and global well posedness of evolution equations driven by dissipative MPVFs. Our approach is based on a measure-theoretic version of the Explicit Euler scheme, for which we prove novel convergence results with optimal error estimates under an abstract stability condition, which do not rely on compactness arguments and also hold when \(\mathsf{X}\) has infinite dimension. We characterize the limit solutions by a suitable Evolution Variational Inequality (EVI), inspired by the Bénilan notion of integral solutions to dissipative evolutions in Banach spaces. Existence, uniqueness and stability of EVI solutions are then obtained under quite general assumptions, leading to the generation of a semigroup of nonlinear contractions.}

A similar result applies to Lipschitz maps in Hilbert spaces, thus providing an invariant version of Kirzsbraun-Valentine extension Theorem. We then provide a relevant application to the case of monotone operators in \(L^p\)-spaces of random variables which are invariant with respect to measure-preserving isomorphisms, proving that they always admit maximal dissipative extensions which are still invariant by measure-preserving isomorphisms. We also show that such operators are law invariant, a much stronger property which is also inherited by their resolvents, the Moreau-Yosida approximations, and the associated semigroup of contractions. These results combine explicit representation formulae for the maximal extension of a monotone operator based on selfdual lagrangians and a refined study of measure-preserving maps in standard Borel spaces endowed with a nonatomic measure, with applications to the approximation of arbitrary couplings between measures by sequences of maps.}

       abstract = {The challenge of approximating functions in infinite-dimensional spaces from finite samples is widely regarded as formidable. In this study, we delve into the challenging problem of the numerical approximation of Sobolev-smooth functions defined on probability spaces. Our particular focus centers on the Wasserstein distance function, which serves as a relevant example. In contrast to the existing body of literature focused on approximating efficiently pointwise evaluations, we chart a new course to define functional approximants by adopting three machine learning-based approaches: 1. Solving a finite number of optimal transport problems and computing the corresponding Wasserstein potentials. 2. Employing empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization in Wasserstein Sobolev spaces. 3. Addressing the problem through the saddle point formulation that characterizes the weak form of the Tikhonov functional's Euler-Lagrange equation. As a theoretical contribution, we furnish explicit and quantitative bounds on generalization errors for each of these solutions. In the proofs, we leverage the theory of metric Sobolev spaces and we combine it with techniques of optimal transport, variational calculus, and large deviation bounds. In our numerical implementation, we harness appropriately designed neural networks to serve as basis functions. These networks undergo training using diverse methodologies. This approach allows us to obtain approximating functions that can be rapidly evaluated after training. Consequently, our constructive solutions significantly enhance at equal accuracy the evaluation speed, surpassing that of state-of-the-art methods by several orders of magnitude.}
